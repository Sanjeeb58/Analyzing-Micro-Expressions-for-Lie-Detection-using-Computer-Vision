# Analyzing-Micro-Expressions-for-Lie-Detection-using-Computer-Vision

## 📘 Project Description

🎭 **Analyzing Micro-Expressions for Lie Detection using Computer Vision** is an AI-powered research initiative focused on detecting concealed emotions through **subtle facial expressions**. Micro-expressions are **brief, involuntary facial movements** that can indicate when someone is being deceptive — often occurring in high-stress situations and lasting just fractions of a second.

This project harnesses the power of **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** to detect and classify these expressions, providing an innovative solution for **non-intrusive lie detection**.
